ndctl-zero-labels(1)
====================

NAME
----
ndctl-zero-labels - zero out the label area on a dimm or set of dimms

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'ndctl zero-labels' <nmem0> [<nmem1>..<nmemN>] [<options>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The namespace label area is a small persistent partition of capacity
available on some NVDIMM devices.  The label area is used to resolve
aliasing between 'pmem' and 'blk' capacity by lineating namespace
boundaries.  This command resets the device to its default state by
deleting all labels.

OPTIONS
-------

<memory device(s)>...::
	One or more 'nmemX' device names. The keyword 'all' can be specified to
	zero every dimm in the system, optionally filtered by bus id (see --bus=
	option).

-b::
--bus=::
	Limit zeroing to memory devices (dimms) that are on the given bus.
	Where 'bus' can be a provider name or a bus id number.

-v::
	Turn on verbose debug messages in the library (if ndctl was built with
	logging and debug enabled).
