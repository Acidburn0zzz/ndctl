======================

NAME
----
ndctl-sanitize-dimm - Perform a cryptographic destruction of the contents of
the given NVDIMM(s)

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'ndctl sanitize-dimm' <nmem0> [<nmem1>..<nmemN>] [<options>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The 'sanitize-dimm' command performs a cryptographic destruction of the
contents of the given NVDIMM. It scrambles the data, and any metadata or
info-blocks, but it doesn't modify namespace labels. Therefore, any
namespaces on regions associated with the given NVDIMM will be retained,
but they will end up in the 'raw' mode.

Additionally, after completion of this command, the security and passphrase
for the given NVDIMM will be disabled, and the passphrase and any key material
will also be removed from the keyring and the ndctl keys directory at
{ndctl_keysdir}
