ndctl-sanitize-dimm(1)
======================

NAME
----
ndctl-sanitize-dimm - sanitize the data on the NVDIMM

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'ndctl sanitize' <dimm> [<options>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Provide a generic interface to crypto erase a NVDIMM.
Ndctl will search the user key ring for the associated DIMM. If no key is
found, it will attempt to load the key blob from the expected location. Ndctl
will remove the key and the key blob once security is disabled.

OPTIONS

	Path to where key related files resides. This parameter is optional
	and the default is set to /etc/ndctl/keys.
